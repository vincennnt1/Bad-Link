# Bad-Link

**Created for the 2022 Mini Jam 111 Hackathon**

Bad-Link was made in 48 hours for the 111th Mini Jam, with a theme of Colors. 

## How to Play

To complete a level in this game, you must have the players in both rectangles enter the right box at the same time.
Each player starts in the same position, but there are different obstacles on each side to help offset players.

## Tech Stack

- **C++**  
- **SFML** (for graphics and audio)
- **NO game engine** (I had to code all the logic from scratch)
